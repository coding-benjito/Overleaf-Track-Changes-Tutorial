\section{Introduction}

In this paper, I would like to shortly introduce the \textit{honey bee} to you.

\section{Results}

Due to its ability to create intense body vibration, the bumble bee out-competes the honey bee in pollination activity at low temperatures.

The honey bee is a generalist in terms of pollination. This means that for most plants which depend on biotic pollination, there is typically another species which is a drastically more efficient pollinator. Due to anthropogenic-support of the honey bee, they eliminate food sources due to their much higher numbers. This yields reduction of the more specialized pollinators, which reduces overall efficiency.
